A clear long-lower-wick (bullish pin bar) formed at the recent wick low and price has recovered into the 0.64940–0.64885 tight support zone (shadow-to-shadow). Nearest resistance sits near the top of the visible scale (~0.65250). Volume/volatility picked up during the rejection and recovery but current candles are moderate — a scalping buy at this support has moderate conviction."

The pattern is recent (within the last ~5–10 candles) and aligns with the 15-min zone, so immediate-scalp entry is supported. Zone set to a strict 20-pip width starting at the 15-min zone low to include the core overlap."
