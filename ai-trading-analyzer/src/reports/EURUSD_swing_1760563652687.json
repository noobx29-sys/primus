    "reasoning": "Dominant higher highs and higher lows over the visible broad context indicate an uptrend. Price is sitting at/near recent highs (resistance area) rather than at support, and there is no clear recent bullish engulfing candle near the current price within the last 20–30 candles. In an uptrend we should look to buy at support on a bullish engulfing; therefore the correct action now is to wait for a pullback to a relevant support zone and a confirmed bullish engulfing before entering."

The full wick-to-wick range was broader than the 20–30 pip constraint, so I narrowed to the most actionable core overlap (25 pips). No Daily zone was provided (marked as '-'), so it does not overlap."
