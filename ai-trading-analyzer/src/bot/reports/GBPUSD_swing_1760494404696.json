    "reasoning": "Over the visible 30–50 daily candles the chart shows higher major highs (peak ~1.39) and higher major lows (low ~1.22 then higher lows toward the right), so the dominant bias is an uptrend. Current price is in a pullback near recent support (~1.32–1.335 area), but I do not see a recent bullish engulfing candle on the rightmost 20–30 candles that would qualify as a valid buy trigger at support. Therefore no valid pattern or actionable zone — wait for a clear bullish engulfing at a nearby support before taking a buy."
