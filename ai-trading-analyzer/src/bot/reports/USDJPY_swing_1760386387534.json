I examined the rightmost 20–30 candles for a recent bullish engulfing at a nearby support zone and did not find a clear wick-to-wick bullish engulfing pattern close to the current price. Because there is no valid recent bullish engulfing pattern near current price, do not enter; wait for a valid bullish engulfing at a nearby support (or a clear pullback into a defined support zone) before taking a buy."
